what is a class in javascript?

In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It is a way to define a template or a structure for objects that share common properties and methods. Classes were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) to make it easier to work with object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

Here's a basic example of how to define a class in JavaScript:


class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}


javascript

In this example, we've defined a Person class with a constructor method that sets the name and age properties of a person object. It also has a sayHello method, which can be called on instances of the Person class to display a greeting message.

To create an instance of a class, you use the new keyword:

const person1 = new Person('Alice', 30);
const person2 = new Person('Bob', 25);

person1.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
person2.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Bob and I am 25 years old.


Classes provide a way to organize and encapsulate data and behavior, which is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. They make it easier to create and manage objects with consistent structures and methods.
